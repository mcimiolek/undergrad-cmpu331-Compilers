Read Me File

In order to run the Compiler please change File testfile in the Compiler class to the path where the test file is saved. After that everything should run from the Main class. The output will be the final set of code stored in Quadruples alltvi after the parser has finally finished.

Important Things:
1) I have updated my code to meet the coding standards and conventions. This included renaming all of my functions and variables, adding lots of comments, and making sure all of my curly braces were set up correctly.
2) I fixed my prefix error, they should all be correct now.
3) I made sure all of exponentials defaulted to being reals.
4) I made sure that my code ignored case in identifiers.
5) Added an option to print the parse stack horizontally instead of veritcally.
6) I am using an identical copy of the ultimate test as my test file.
